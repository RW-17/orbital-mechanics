# orbital-mechanics
A series of Python scripts used to solve exercises of the Orbital Mechanics course at ETSIAE using the NumPy package.
The first exercise includes 2 functions that output all the required parameters. Initial arrays of position and velocity must be created. The output tuple can be asigned and sliced to obtain the required parameters.
